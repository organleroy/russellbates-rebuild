# russellbates-rebuild (ARCHIVED)

This repository contains the **historical Eleventy rebuild work** for  
**russellbates.com**, created during the migration from WordPress to a
modern static Eleventy (11ty) site.

## Status

🚫 **This repository is NOT the live site.**  
🚫 **Do not make changes here expecting them to deploy.**

It is preserved as a **reference archive** only.

## Live Site

The live, deployed site now lives in:

👉 https://github.com/organleroy/organleroy.github.io

All active development, fixes, and enhancements should be made there.

## Why this repo still exists

This archive is intentionally retained to:

- Preserve architectural and editorial decision history
- Serve as a reference for how the rebuild evolved
- Avoid mixing historical work into the live deployment repo

It may be read, searched, or referenced — but should not be extended.
